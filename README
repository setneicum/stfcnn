# stfcnn
Supervised-training fully-connected neural network

stfcnn is a C implementation of a fully connected with supervised training,
fully-connected meaning that each node of a given layer is connected to all
nodes on the next layer, and supervised training means the training data
has to have a known result and this has to be provided to the network.

Currently this is a part of a bigger project and the probability of something
breaking or not working correctly is high, so if you plan to use this as is
keep that in mind. When the parent project is done I will document this project
properly and add some example tests and data here.
